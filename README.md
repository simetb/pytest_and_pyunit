# Testing Practices Repository

Welcome to the Testing Practices Repository! This repository contains implementations of testing methods using PyUnit and PyTest frameworks for Python.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide examples and demonstrations of how to effectively implement testing practices in Python projects using both PyUnit and PyTest frameworks. Testing is an essential aspect of software development that ensures the reliability and robustness of code, and these examples aim to showcase best practices and techniques for writing and running tests.

## Contents

This repository includes the following:

- **PyUnit Examples**: Implementations of test cases using the PyUnit framework, which is Python's standard unit testing framework. PyUnit follows the xUnit style of test case design and execution.

- **PyTest Examples**: Demonstrations of test cases using the PyTest framework, which is a popular testing framework for Python. PyTest offers a more concise and readable syntax compared to PyUnit, making it a preferred choice for many Python developers.

## Getting Started

To get started with testing using PyUnit or PyTest, refer to the respective documentation provided in the `docs` directory:

- [PyUnit Documentation](docs/pyunit_documentation.md)
- [PyTest Documentation](docs/pytest_documentation.md)

These documents contain detailed explanations of how to set up, write, and execute tests using each framework. Additionally, they include examples and tips for writing effective test cases.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have additional examples, improvements, or suggestions, feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can make this repository a valuable resource for Python developers learning about testing practices.
